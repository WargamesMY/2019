1. Maximum of three(3) people per team
2. No off-the-shelf automated scanning tools such as Nessus, OpenVAS, etc. It's useless and we'll kick you out for that lame ass shit

5. Absolutely no sabotaging of other competing players, or in any way hindering their independent progress
6. No brute forcing of challenge flag or keys against the scoring server
