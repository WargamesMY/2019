#### *Rules*

```text
1. Maximum of three(3) people per team
2. No off-the-shelf automated scanning tools such as Nessus, OpenVAS, etc. It's useless and we'll kick you out for that lame ass shit

4. No attacking the competition infrastructure. If bugs or vulns are found, please alert the competition organizers immediately
5. Absolutely no sabotaging of other competing players, or in any way hindering their independent progress
6. No brute forcing of challenge flag or keys against the scoring server
7. No flooding or DoS attacks. Teams caught in the act will be penalized by a time penalty or a disqualification.
